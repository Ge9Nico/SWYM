## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
- [Firebase account](https://firebase.google.com/) and a new project created.
- [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli) installed and configured (`npm install -g firebase-tools`)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/swym.git](https://github.com/your-username/swym.git)
    cd swym
    ```

2.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Install backend dependencies:**
    ```sh
    cd functions
    npm install
    cd ..
    ```

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project. This file will store your Firebase configuration and API keys. **Do not commit this file to version control.**

    ```env
    # .env
    # Get these from your Firebase project settings
    VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY="YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY"
    VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="YOUR_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN"
    VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID"
    VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="YOUR_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET"
    VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="YOUR_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID"
    VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID="YOUR_FIREBASE_APP_ID"

    # Get this from Google AI Studio
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
    ```

5.  **Connect to your Firebase Project:**
    ```sh
    firebase use --add
    ```
    Select the Firebase project you created for SWYM.

### Usage

- **Run the local development server (frontend):**
  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```
  This will start the React app, usually on `http://localhost:5173`.

- **Deploy the application:**
  1.  **Build the frontend:**
      ```sh
      npm run build
      ```
  2.  **Deploy everything to Firebase:**
      ```sh
      firebase deploy
      ```
      Or deploy services individually:
      ```sh
      firebase deploy --only hosting  # Deploy only the frontend
      firebase deploy --only functions # Deploy only the backend
      ```
